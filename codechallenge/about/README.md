# Goals

## Documenting My Skill Development Progress

I'm primarily going to be writing about the various tools and technologies that I'm interested in, and creating a space for discussion focused on tech and tech job market trends.

- Programming Paradigms - Functional vs OOP, TDD vs BDD vs CDD, Statically Typed languages vs Dynamically Typed Languages

- Programming Languages - Focus on Java, Javascript/Typescript, Python, PHP, and either Go or Elixir(help me decide, plz)

- Frameworks, Architecture, and Services - Distributed systems, cloud services, database technologies,

- Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science - I'm back in school(yes again) studying mathematics. You bet your boots we're gonna talk math

## Documenting My Experience

I'll be doing what I can to focus my efforts on discussing topics that I find relevant to modern technology development and what sort of projects I'm working on with various clients.
